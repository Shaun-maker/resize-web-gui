- Grid system to display thumbnails images inside the light red container
" Add picture(s)".
    - When only one image, display one big image that take all the height of the
    container
    - When we have multiple image, display all in a grid that fit inside the
    light red container

When we click on submit button :
    - Do again a checkInput to see if at least one checkbox in each field is checked,
    and if at least one image is upload.
    - Add a check valid image to see if the file is really an image file
    - create formData object, add all form field inside the formData
    - Send it to PHP backend

Test if value of HTML form is set to 100 instead of "100", do we have integer ?
