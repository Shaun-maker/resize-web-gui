    <img width="400" src="/assets/images/screenshot/resize-web-single-image.png" alt="Only one image added by the user">
    <img width="400" src="/assets/images/screenshot/resize-web-more-images.png" alt="A lot of images added by the user">
</p>
<sup>Thanks to Laracasts for the pictures</sup>

Once you click on the "Resize and convert" button, you have a dynamic refresh of images grid, for each images being resized

    <img width="400" src="/assets/images/screenshot/resize-web-start-resize.png" alt="Images start resizing">
    <img width="400" src="/assets/images/screenshot/resize-web-start-resize-2.png" alt="Images start resizing">
</p>

After that, you have a zip file if you upload multiples images, or directy a single image if you add only one.

For multiple images: All images are stored in separate folders. In these folders: one folder per format, then all sizes in the format folder.
